# Campus Placement and Salary Prediction: Leveraging Machine Learning for Enhanced Employability

## Models Used

- SVM (Support Vector Machine) for Placement Prediction (Classification)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for Placement Prediction (Classification)
- Logistic Regression for Placement Prediction (Classification) and Salary Prediction (Regression)
- Gradient Boosting Machines for Salary Prediction (Regression)
- Random Forest for Salary Prediction (Regression)

## Structure of the Repository
1. **[PredictiveModels](https://github.com/fromjyce/HireMeHorizon/tree/PredictiveModels)** Branch contains all models that were involved in the development for placement prediction and salary estimation.
2. **[Raahul-codes](https://github.com/fromjyce/HireMeHorizon/tree/Raahul-codes)** Branch  contains only those models that were involved in the development for placement prediction.
3. **[Campus_Placement_and_Salary_Prediction](https://github.com/fromjyce/HireMeHorizon/blob/PredictiveModels/Campus_Placement_and_Salary_Prediction.pdf)** - The research paper written by us comprehensively explains our models and their results.

## Running the Programs
The programs have been tested on the Visual Studio Code IDE in Windows 11.
***You are free to choose any IDE that suits your needs.***
